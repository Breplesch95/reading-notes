<h1>How the web works</h1>

**<h2>Clients and servers</h2>**

Computers connected to the internet are called **clients** and **servers**.

**Clients** are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like Firefox or Chrome).

**Servers** are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.

<h2>the other parts of the toolbox</h2>

**Internet connection**: Allows you to send and receive data on the web. It's basically like the street between your house and the shop.

**TCP/IP**: **Transmission Control Protocol** and **Internet Protocol** are communication protocols that define how data should travel across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).

**DNS**: **Domain Name System** is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the address of the shop so you can access it.

**HTTP**: **Hypertext Transfer Protocol** is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.

**Component files**: A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy from the shop. These files come in two main types:
**Code files**: Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

**Assets**: This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.

<h2>What tools do proffesionals use?</h2>

**A computer**. For serious web development, it's better to invest in a desktop or laptop computer running Windows, macOS or Linux.

**A text editor**, to write code in. This could be a text editor (e.g. Visual Studio Code, Notepad++, Sublime Text, GNU Emacs, or VIM), or a hybrid editor (e.g. Dreamweaver or WebStorm). Office document editors are not suitable, as they rely on hidden elements that interfere with the rendering engines used by web browsers.

**Web browsers**, to test code in. The most-used browsers at this time are Firefox, Chrome, Opera, Safari, Internet Explorer and Microsoft Edge. You should also test how your site performs on mobile devices and on any old browsers your target audience may still be using (such as IE 8–10). Lynx, a text-based terminal web browser, is great for seeing how your site is experienced by visually-impaired users.

A **Graphics editor**, like GIMP, Figma, Paint.NET, Photoshop, Sketch or XD

A **version control system**, to manage files on servers, collaborate on a project with a team, share code and assets and avoid editing conflicts. Right now, Git is the most popular version control system along with the GitHub or GitLab hosting service.

An **FTP program**, used on older web hosting accounts to manage files on servers (Git is increasingly replacing FTP for this purpose). There are loads of (S)FTP programs available *including* Cyberduck, Fetch and FileZilla.

An **automation system**, like Webpack, Grunt, or Gulp to automatically perform repetitive tasks, such as minifying code and running tests.

**Libraries**, **frameworks**, etc., to speed up writing common functionality. A **library** tends to be an existing JavaScript or CSS file that provides ready-rolled functionality for you to make use of in your code. A **framework** tends to take this idea further, offering a complete system with some custom syntaxes for you to write a web app on top of.
