<h1>Hello, I’m Breanna Plescher!</h1>

-My pronouns are *she/her*.

I’m here to **_broaden my horizons, improve my computer skills, and learn how to properly code._** I can’t wait to get started learning with you guys!

**Growth Mindset** is the belief that a person can develop and improve themselves with hard work and perserverance.

I’ll keep *myself* in a **Growth Mindset** by admitting when I need help, putting in genuine effort, and rolling with the punches.
